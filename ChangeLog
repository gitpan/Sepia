	* Sepia.jpg: don't ask -- just look.
	
	* sepia.el (sepia-ident-at-point): fixed bug with sigils.
	(sepia-complete-symbol): fixed bug with undefined function
	sepia-end-of-word.  
	Always use Data::Dumper.

	* any-repl.el: new file implementing REPL, basically stolen from
	Slime.

	* pscope.el: renamed to sepia.el to go with name change.

	* pscope.el (pscope-set-found): remove locations with no
	file in package "main", which were causing errors before.
	(pscope-dwim): new function.  New functions
	pscope-complete-symbol and pscope-indent-or-complete for
	symbol completion.  Not well-tested, but they seem to work.
	The most annoying thing is that since the Xref db isn't
	automatically updated, it won't always know as much as you
	expect.
	(pscope-load-file): new function.

	* Xref.pm: update export lists to reflect new functions.

2004-04-02  Sean O'Rourke  <seano@cs.ucsd.edu>

	* Xref.pm: minor cleanup.

	* pscope.el: pass module, file, line to Perl side (where it's
	ignored for now); fix line number refinement to be a
	little less over-eager; fix pscope-callees to go to sub
	definitions instead of call sites.
	
	* README: added TODO section.
