<h3 class="section">1.2 Philosophy</h3>

<p>A development environment should support three activities: code
spelunking, interaction, and customization.  Emacs as an environment for
developing Emacs Lisp thoroughly supports all of them: It has commands
to visit individual functions' code and documentation, commands to
evaluate or step through expressions, and an architecture that
encourages customization in Emacs Lisp.  As an environment for Perl,
however, it is lacking: there is limited interactivity with the Perl
debugger, and reasonable documentation browsing, but no support for
navigating, editing, and re-evaluating code.  Sepia attempts to remedy
the situation.

   <p>Modern IDEs also support these three activities, but do so awkwardly. 
Rather than having functions to visit definitions (<kbd>find-function</kbd>)
and search for functions (<kbd>apropos</kbd>), they clutter the screen with
class and file trees.  Rather than supporting interactive evaluation of
small pieces of code, they perform background semantic checking on whole
projects and highlight errors.  Rather than allowing minor
customizations to grow organically into features, they support limited
configuration files and baroque plug-in APIs.  Sepia tries to adhere to
the apparent Emacs philosophy that rich semantic information should be
unobtrusive, and that the best way to build working code is to start
by experimenting with small pieces.

   <p>Language support packages for Emacs vary widely in the degree to which
they make use of or replace existing Emacs features.  Minimal modes
provide keyword-based syntax highlighting and an unadorned comint buffer
as an interpreter.  Others provide their own specialized equivalents of
comint, eldoc, completion, and other Emacs features.  Sepia takes a
third approach by trying to do as much as possible with existing Emacs
features, even when they are not optimal for Perl.  It uses comint to
communicate with the subprocess, eldoc to display documentation, and
grep to list source locations.

   <p>This approach has three advantages: First, it maximizes the number of
features that can be supported with limited development time.  Second,
it respects users' settings.  A seasoned Emacs user may have changed
hundreds of settings, so a mode that reimplements features will have to
support equivalent settings, and will force the user to re-specify them. 
Finally, this approach respects decades of development spent, as Neal
Stephenson put it, &ldquo;focused with maniacal intensity on the deceptively
simple-seeming problem of editing text.&rdquo;  Many non-obvious choices go
into making a polished interface, and while a reimplementation gets rid
of accumulated cruft, it must rediscover these hidden trade-offs.

   <p>Anyways, I hope you enjoy using Sepia.  Its development style is strange
for someone used Perl's typical mix of one-liners and edit-save-run, but
once you are accustomed to it, you may find it very effective.
